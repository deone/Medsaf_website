                  MEDSAF has a very robust supply chain unit, Now we are not
                  bothered to check the source of these suppliers or whoâ€™s the
                  manufacturer, is it genuine or not, is it original or fake,
                  what is the quality assurance system, where the products are
                  stored. All of these issues we are not concerned now, because
                  MEDSAF takes care of them

                  We use to deal with so many suppliers, we had about 40 to 50
                  different suppliers, so that alone was an administrative
                  burden, sending requests to different suppliers, having to
                  process payment was and administrative nightmare. since we
                  started working with MEDSAF, i can say that all the challenges
                  went away. With MEDSAF the process is pretty streamlined,
                  there was speed and quality of service
